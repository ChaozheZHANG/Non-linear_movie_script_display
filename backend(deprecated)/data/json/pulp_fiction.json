Your granddadwas a Marine and he was killed withall the other Marines at the battleof Wake Island. Your granddad wasfacing death and he knew it.

So he hid it in the oneplace he knew he could hide somethin'.His ass. Five long years, he worethis watch up his ass. Then when hedied of dysentery, he gave me thewatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunkof metal up my ass for two years.Then, after seven years, I was senthome to my family. And now, littleman, I give the watch to you.",
